# pedantic-python-project
Python project best practice is messy. None of the tools at any point, whether testing; packaging; promotion to release; or publishing documentation are ideal. This entire world gets more complicated when you add to it: 
- A chosen source code management system,
- A chosen CI environment,
- and working in a team.

`pedantic-python-project` is a python project skeleton, designed for small teams to develop python _libraries_ and _command line tools_ on Github or Github Enterprise using github actions, inspired by the work done with [compliance-trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle). Much of the functionality is delegated to `make` to ease translation across platforms. However, the tools chosen and workflows are opinionated by design.
